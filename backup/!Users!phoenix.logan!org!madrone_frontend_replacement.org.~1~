* Madrone Front End Replacement Options

** Nextstrain/Auspice
*** General:
- Written with Node and React

*** Pros:
- visualizations look nice and modern. 
- can add our own visualizations if needed.
- can host locally
*** Cons:
- Doesn't seem to be designed to be customized.
- How would we handle middleware such as authentication?
- We may need to maintain a fork of it if we are using it outside of main usecase.


** Pathoenwatch/Microreact
- looks like it's intended to be an upload your data sort of thing, cant find anything about hosting it 
locally or the repo. Maybe we can use the api to submit data (returns temp url)
*** Pros:
- lucy said that the developers are interested in collaboration? 
*** Cons:
- Visualizations look more dated.
- Can't find repo, is this opensource?


* Issues with current front end:
- not modern (not as sleek as competitors)
- missing features (searching/narrowing results, login)
- not intuitive user interface
- navbar/basics

* UX Improvements Needed
- large trees
- focus on clusters and not heatmap / tabbed view
- not able to handle large trees

* Development 
- no one here is a javascript engineer
- whatever we do to improve front end should be limited

* TODOS:
- email trevor about packaging components

* What we need:
- customizablility, we need to be able to add in changes asked for by ACDPH
- Roughly a similar state to what the current site is.
