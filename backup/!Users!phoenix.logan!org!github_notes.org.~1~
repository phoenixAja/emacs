* Github Notes:

*** To get the differences between upstream and fork origin:
git diff @{upstream}

<branchname>@{upstream}, e.g. master@{upstream}, @{u}
The suffix @{upstream} to a branchname (short form <branchname>@{u}) refers to the branch that 
the branch specified by branchname is set to build on top of (configured with branch.<name>.remote
 and branch.<name>.merge). A missing branchname defaults to the current one.
